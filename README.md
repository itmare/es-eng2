#### Installation and Configuration

-	Deploy and start an Elasticsearch cluster that satisfies a given set of requirements
-	Configure the nodes of a cluster to satisfy a given set of requirements
-	Secure a cluster using Elasticsearch Security ([doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/security.html)\)
-	Define role-based access control using Elasticsearch Security ([doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/development-security-rbac.html)\)

#### Indexing Data

-	Define an index that satisfies a given set of requirements

-	Perform index, create, read, update, and delete operations on the documents of an index

-	Define and use index aliases

-	Define and use an index template for a given pattern that satisfies a given set of requirements

-	Define and use a dynamic template that satisfies a given set of requirements

-	Use the Reindex API and Update By Query API to reindex and/or update documents

-	Define and use an ingest pipeline that satisfies a given set of requirements, including the use of Painless to modify documents

#### Queries

-	Write and execute a search query for terms and/or phrases in one or more fields of an index

-	Write and execute a search query that is a Boolean combination of multiple queries and filters

-	Highlight the search terms in the response of a query

-	Define and use multi-fields with different data types and/or analyzers

-	Configure an index so that it properly maintains the relationships of nested arrays of objects

-	Configure an index that implements a parent/child relationship

#### Cluster Administration

-	Allocate the shards of an index to specific nodes based on a given set of requirements

-	Configure shard allocation awareness and forced awareness for an index

-	Diagnose shard issues and repair a cluster’s health

-	Backup and restore a cluster and/or specific indices
